            Firstly, in regard to VSCode I found it to be an extremely productive tool for writing the CSS and HTML code, whilst not a necessary tool it gives you the ability to check your code on the fly and check for errors. I think VSCode is efficient because you can access numerous files of code with the multi-view tool, combine this with using multiple monitors and you can save so much time in navigating back and forth between pieces of code. Moving on to Trello I believe it was instrumental in keeping my project on track as I could organise all the information I needed to contain on the website in one place, including all my references.  The kanban method (to do, doing, done) is an incredibly effective tool for both productivity and efficiency, allowing you to see how much progress you have already made and gauging how far within your time constraint you are. In questioning whether I could have been more efficient on the project I do believe so, I could have perhaps utilised the Trello board to really break up the tasks into smaller subcategories which would have given me the motivation to attack the task more fervently. I believe I wasted a decent chunk of time figuring out how to structure my code as and when I needed to, in the future I would do more in depth research before I began coding so that I could go back and refer to my notes instead of researching every time I needed a bit of info. Relative to this task I think it would have been possible to do it in teams but it would have slowed the process down somewhat as the creative aspect of the project probably would have taken up more time than it needed to. It definitely would have complicated things to have multiple people coding their section and then splicing that code together at the end and making sure it is formatted properly. Overall It could have worked as a team project if planned properly but I don’t think it would have been as seamless as a solo project.

            The research aspect of the project really should have held more weight than it did for me, in hindsight it would have been exponentially more efficient and productive to get as much research and info gathering out of the way before I began coding. This way would have left me more time to code without interruption, which did tend to slow me down often. Touching on the research I think it would have been a better idea to gather excerpts of code and the logic behind them and compile this information on Trello so i could revisit it when coding, without trawling through the web trying to find what I was looking for. Also I could have included more productivity tools like Trello to aid me in different aspects of the project, apps such as monday.com which is virtually a spreadsheet but with added versatility, allowing you to switch the view of the work you have on there from a map or a list.

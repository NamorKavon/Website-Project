The role of IT in the modern world is an integral and necessary one. 
Innovation, efficiency and productivity have seen a quantum surge in the 
21st century and business is taking full advantage of this fact. 
Look to the world of online shopping and how the high street brick and 
mortar stores are suffering as a result. The experience of shopping for 
clothes is slowly being replaced by the relative ease of browsing through 
hundreds of clothing items in a considerably quicker manner, all of this 
without ever leaving the comfort of your home. The rise of social media 
a ‘la Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat has given marketing a digital makeover.
It is no longer cost effective to solely advertise with billboards and 
newspapers when influencers with millions of followers can reach such a 
broad audience, with the added benefit of targeting the specific market 
you want and not just people who happen to notice an advertisement on the 
back of a bus. Communication is as much a part of using IT as any other, 
in today’s world we can seamlessly talk to the entire company, of which 
there could be 500 staff members, at the click of a button. This allows 
employees to relay information quickly and concisely without having to 
wait hours or days for a response. 

In a world gone by a company may store a swathe of physical files and folders in an entire offices worth of space, it would be tediously slow to sift through and no matter how organised it never did and never will compete with digital organisation systems. We can now store practically unlimited amounts of documents that the whole company can access within seconds with a simple search request, expediting the process by a considerable amount. Customer relationship management also is now a fantastic method to use when communicating with a customer; we can within seconds access their purchase history, address/billing details, any previous complaints and effectively use this information to make the procedure more seamless and pleasant for the customer. The best part being each interaction is a bit more information to be added to the system so the next experience can be even better for the consumer.

            Before I began coding I set out by answering all the relevant project questions and made sure that they matched the assigned brief. Secondly I began researching information on HTML web pages and how they are designed in CSS, I added a link on Trello to a couple of websites that encapsulate a vast amount of information on web pages and learnt the basics of building a website in VSCode. Then came the navigation for the website, I decided early on to use a navigation bar at the top of the website which contains all the buttons to each page of the site. I wanted it to be clear and easily visible on every page, with labels for each button telling the user exactly what page they were navigating to. For the code created in CSS I used classes to direct the formatting and colouring to each page, separating the headers, paragraphs and navigation buttons. To format the text into its correct position I used margins, width, font size, font weight and height. I also changed all of the text from Times New Roman (default) to a more aesthetically pleasing font across the website. In regard to changing file formats I did not need to edit any for functionality or aesthetic purposes, the images I used for the background were simple .jpg and .PNG files that were simple to incorporate and worked without having to edit their properties or format. Finally, after the website was fully built I scanned through multiple times and made sure there were no bugs, for instance making sure every navigation button on every page was functional and checking for any grammatical or formatting errors. I also ran through the code I had written to make sure there were no forgotten lines of code producing unwanted results on the website i.e. an invisible button randomly placed on the page that directed you nowhere.

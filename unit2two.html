            In order for anyone of any disability to use the Web we need to create, develop and use tools that aid them in doing so. The types of disabilities fall into these specific categories; auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. If we have information that is displayed on screen but someone is fully or partially blind then we may employ some form of text-to-speech and inversely, if someone is hard of hearing or completely deaf then closed captions are commonly used to convert speech or sound into text on screen so the person can still receive that same information. It is vital that whatever disability a person may have it does not prevent them for using the web effectively, an individual who has poor eyesight will need the text on screen to be enlarged in most instances and we can do this easily from inside the operating system, Windows offers their Ease of Access program which enables users to use a wide array of accessibility options to assist them in using their PC. The narrator is an intuitive tool that allows whatever is being displayed on the screen to be read aloud, for those who are colourblind you can enable colour filters which allow you to make everything greyscale or alternatively choose from 1 of their 3 colourblind option, deuteranopia, protanopia and tritanopia. For those who are affected by various motions on screen you can disable a lot of animations. Another important aspect to consider is the readability of text on web pages, sometimes websites suffer from having text that can indecipherable or too small to read, this problem can be solved by simply magnifying the page, which is a function offered by all widely used browsers. More recently you can now instruct the computer to do a lot of tasks for you, using apps like Cortana on windows you can carry out many tasks using your voice, things like opening apps and searching on the web are relatively straight forward. Apps integrated with Windows 10 work much better than the ones that arenâ€™t.

            The internet is usable with a wide array of file types with many different functionalities. .Avi is for audio/video and can be used to display videos on websites, it cannot however be streamed so you will need to download the entire file before it is played. .CSS is of vital importance to website building, this will define the look of your website and is almost always used in website design. .Gif is an increasingly popular format used on a multitude of websites, often appearing on social media apps like Twitter and Facebook this file type is commonly associated with video playback without sound but can also contain sound. .HTML is obviously a key component in web page design, almost all pages will have their core functionality designed in HTML, later to be designed in CSS. .JPG or .JPEG is an extensively popular file type for images, whilst there are others out there most images you will see are probably JPG/JPEG. .MP3 shares some similarities with JPG in the sense it is such a common file type for audio files, especially music as the files are extremely compressed and as such are easily downloadable in small file sizes. .TXT is perhaps the most simple of the file types usually displaying raw/plain text without any format, websites like PasteBin employ this as one of their main tools. The list could continue as there are many more types that could be discussed but I feel I have covered the most used/most popular.

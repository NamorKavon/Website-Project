        In figuring out the systems required and software you’ll need there is a general framework of questions you must ask and answer before beginning your search; what is the scope of the project and how complex is it going to be? How quick is the development speed and what will be the cost of that development as well as IT experts you may employ? What are the technical requirements of the project and what tools/ready-made solutions are already available to help aid you in moving forward? We can divide digital projects into 3 basic groups; Simple, medium and large. A simple digital project is going to consist of things like a business’ website, a phone application or a small-scale online store, it’s going to require much less time, resources and money than the next 2 groups and ready-made templates are often available to assist you. Medium projects are where things start to get more drawn out and complicated, we’re looking at complex online stores that have a nationwide scope and also national scale services like the government gateway. This usually requires a framework to work from that’s personally built for the project and would involve a bigger team of people than its smaller counterpart. The largest of the 3 groups is really expanding the digital project to its most complex and involved stage. Wikipedia is perhaps the most prominent example of such a project, a website consisting of an almost innumerable amount of topics and pages that are pulled from sources all over the web. This group are exclusively built using high level programming languages like Python and Javascript and take a good level of experience to maintain.

        In order to build the HTML and CSS code I used VSCode which provided the structure for the website. Being able to get HTML and CSS to interact within the same program is very convenient and useful to make quick changes and test them efficiently. VSCode is also incredibly intuitive, using the example of simply typing HTML5 and having multiple lines of code printed for you is good for time efficiency. Trello is a great tool to provide all the organisation to the project, having each step or process laid out in simple cards on the board allows you to figure out exactly how much progress you have made and how much you have left to do. Within the cards I contained the research references in the activity section so I could return to them later if I needed a little bit more information. I also used a card for examples of code I could use on the website, I preferred to contain this within Trello rather than having notes disorganised on the desktop. In relation to GitHub and how it can be useful for a codes version control, it allows you to save iterations of your work, be that script for code, data or notes. With each file you upload you create a history of your work and can easily sift through the progress you have made to make changes and review the process, as well as the added benefit of having an online backup of all your code.

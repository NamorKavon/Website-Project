    The layout of the website is a simple but functional approach. I will have my landing page which contains the ‘About me’ section, aesthetically I have chosen to include a 
background image that contrasts well with the text on the page for each Unit. At the top of the page I will place the navigation bar which will give you the option to choose which Unit page to go to. I want to avoid big walls of text that feel like a chore to traverse through so each page will be concise and split up into separate smaller paragraphs to make it more readable. For Unit 1 I have decided to do 2 questions per page so within each page you can see the answers to that section of the coursework, it feels to me a functional compromise between having everything contained within one page and giving a page to each and every answer. The text on first review was a little bit too laborious so I have split it up into more digestible chunks, perhaps a few sentences for each paragraph. I have centred the header to make the website look cleaner, with a possible exception here or there for adding images. There is a general colour scheme throughout the website that stays consistent with the theme, to avoid a rainbow of colours that appear chaotic and unorganised. I am currently looking at different text styles as Times New Roman is very basic and doesn’t stand out on the page at all. The general pattern of the pages will largely be the same, each will have my answers aligned under the question.

    In the UK we have the copyright, designs and patents Act 1988 which protects original creations in literary work, art, music, sound and film. An extension to this is the copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 which simply extends the copyright law to software as well. As soon as a website is live on the internet it is protected by this law. Many websites, if not almost all, will contain a copyright notice at the footer of a page which tells you when the copyright is registered from and to. There are many other iterations of laws around the world which dictate their own policy and rules such as World Intellectual Property Organisation and the Universal Copyright Convention. Obviously it is incredibly easy to steal intellectual property from a website and usually a cease and desist letter will be enough for the perpetrator to stop stealing content.
We also have to take into account the fair use policy, allowing individuals and businesses to limited use of copyrighted material for the benefit of the public or perhaps for someone to critique and very commonly for reviews. Whilst you may be disheartened by an angry comment left on Google about the design of your website and they are using examples of your work to make their argument, it does not infringe on your rights as the copyright holder and they are free to do so. In terms of your copyright extending to multiple countries and territories, a lot of those are covered by acts such as the aforementioned Universal Copyright Convention which totals over 150 countries. 
In terms of restraints the one that stands out the most is how a website, no matter how functional, translates onto a mobile or tablet device. There are many websites which work excellently on a desktop and laptop but once you try to access it on a mobile device there are possibly elements missing or parts of the page not loading correctly. To a lesser extent this problem can also affect different sized monitors. Another important constraint is the creativity aspect, a lot of website developers if left to their own devices would endlessly churn out new iterations of the site with very minor changes each time, striving for perfection as all creatives do. This is not however a viable option for the majority of website development, the customer wants a product delivered on time and not costing more than the original price promised, while you may be able to improve slightly with a longer timeframe and bigger budget it doesn’t mean the customer is happy to spend more money or wait longer for their product to be finished.

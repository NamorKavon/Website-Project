        In May 2018 the EU introduced the GDPR legislation, aiming to change the way businesses collect, store and use people's data. There is a wide array of information stored on us as individuals, where we travel to and from, what products we choose to buy and what websites we frequent often. A large portion of this information is used relatively positively, it helps your devices understand how you may take some precious minutes off your journey to work and what sort of products to advertise based on your browsing habits. The legislation dictates people will ultimately have greater control over how their data is shared and who is able to receive that data.<br><br> Under GDPR law we are given 8 basic rights; the right to access our data at our request and asked how it is used, the right to no longer exist on the system and have our data deleted if we choose, the right to have our data transferred from one company to another in a readable and understandable manner, the right to opt in to have data collected and to be explicitly told what is being collected, the right to have data changed to reflect the correct information, the right to restrict what and how much of your data is used by companies, the right to completely object to having your data used without exception and to be informed clearly on this ability and finally the right to be notified within 72 hours if there has been a data breach which could have possibly compromised your personal information. <br><br> In conclusion we can see that the consumer is now exponentially more in charge of the data they share and where it can be used and it affects business in the following ways; data gathering and profiling in which a company can create a repertoire of info to target specific products to benefit the customers needs and henceforth contacting the customer directly, by email, phone, text message etc. Moving forward we will see companies be a lot more strategic in the way they gather data, gone are the days of blindlessly gathering data without a users consent. Businesses will have to be a lot more transparent post-GDPR and failing to adhere will incur a severe penalty, up to 4% of the companies annual income or a maximum of â‚¬20 million imposed as a fine.

            Overall I am satisfied with the final outcome of my project, given the time constraints and relative lack of experience I am pleased with what I have been able to accomplish. Initially I overestimated just how much I would be able to achieve and promised myself the proverbial world in terms of the final product. Realistically I wasn’t too sure what to expect as I have never used HTML or CSS before but after getting to grips with both of the languages I am confident that I did a competent job. 

Regarding the strengths of the final project I believe the coding aspect went well; I used margins and positioning in CSS and changed the bland default text (Times New Roman). With the HTML aspect I included a navigation bar at the top of each page that takes you to whichever part of the website you wish to go to. I am also happy with the aesthetics of the website, I began with the idea of keeping a concise colour theme throughout the website and managed to stick to that idea using a few colours that compliment each other rather well. For each page I used a background image and on certain pages the text is formatted to not impede on the image which was satisfying to code. Originally I had a page for each question as I wasn’t overly confident on using CSS to format multiple blocks of text on a single page, after spending more time using it I ended with 2 questions per page and for this Unit 2 review section I formatted 4 questions on to 1 page. 

Regarding the weaknesses of the final project, I would have liked to add more functionality to the website, maybe incorporating dropdown boxes on the navigation bar. I also wanted to include some images but didn’t end up figuring out a way to include them without having an aesthetically displeasing image in a white square that stood out on the page for all the wrong reasons. Further on this point I would have liked to add a cascading navigation bar that took you to each page with an individual question on it.

            Moving forward I would like to improve my comprehension of CSS and HTML and include more advanced code, beginning with a function to automatically resize the website depending on what resolution it was viewed in. Working on the site on a monitor as well as a laptop caused issues as the layout completely changed when moving from one to the other, in the end I decided to strictly format the website for the laptop. In terms of design, I think there are a swathe of things I could learn to code in CSS that would further improve the look of the website, without a time constraint I could spend more time researching different coding methods that developers commonly use and incorporate some of them. To further improve I would like to make the website more dynamic, as stated previously I’d prefer a cascading style navigation bar that limits the amount of space wasted on the page. I’d like to learn how to code jump links to improve moving around the website, giving the user the option to jump back to the top of the page would be a great feature to include. Regarding the coding element of the project I certainly think I could, with more experience, clean up the code to make it more professional and easy to understand, for me it makes sense and I can understand the approach I have taken but if someone else was to work on the project in the future it could take some time to comprehend. I would include many more notes within the code if I were to do the project again.

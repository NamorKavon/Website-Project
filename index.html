My name is Roman Novak, I have a longstanding background in IT and in every job 
I’ve held there has been some degree of technology usage. I started out building 
gaming PCs after dropping out of college on completion of my first year and that 
kickstarted my passion for the technology industry. Using a PC regularly just 
a couple of years after I started talking I am very comfortable navigating my way 
around a computer and understand on an instinctual level how to troubleshoot 
problems on a multitude of applications and the internet.

I made the decision to join the CodeNation course on the rationale that it 
would be an entry into a career perhaps in software development or even 
website design. My experience with CodeNation so far has been an intriguing 
and intellectually stimulating affair, in which I’ve learnt just how little
I know and conversely how much there is to learn moving forward. 
The general atmosphere of the office is positive and full of character, 
something I find important in creating a workplace that makes you want to 
turn up everyday. I’m a huge proponent of active learning and CodeNation
provides the ultimate method to learn, a crash course in Python which ends 
in a test of your knowledge by building a simple text-based adventure game 
and then moving onto an introduction into HTML which this project
is based on. I am not a great fan of spending several years in University 
learning all of the theory and having no real world experience when I finish
so this course is a great way to gain those real world skills but also still
learning the key aspects of software development.

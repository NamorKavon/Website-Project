        To begin with I used Trello to organise the information chunks on the website, assigning a card to each unit of questions, mainly so that I can keep track of where I am up to but also in case I need to go back and edit any text later on. Provisionally I thought i’d employ a tool such as ‘Slickplan’ to create a flowchart-esque structure of the website. I found a great tool to use online for the general planning of the website, the P.L.A.N acronym - Prepare, Landscape, Aesthetics and Navigation. I need to cleanly and concisely lay out the choices made for how the website will handle and what features it will contain; as well as ensuring the look and feel of the website is professional so it stands out and grabs the users attention, finally I dealt with the navigation of the website and how I intend for users to navigate around the website, initially I thought perhaps a landing page that provides an introduction and then provides the user with options to navigate to any page they wish. I imagine some form of image manipulation software will also be used to add some of the aesthetic aspects to the website. I intended to make the website functionally pleasing as well as aesthetically, placing importance on the looks of the website and making sure it stands out but just as crucially making the feel and navigation a pleasant experience rather than a headache. This would include not placing large blocks of text on a page that you have to endlessly scroll through but rather navigate the unit questions by unit. <br><br> https://trello.com/b/TnJforbI/html-css

        Digital projects can, a lot of the time, fail to produce adequate results or fall below the minimum expectations. Collaboration is a key catalyst in the success of a project and failing to collaborate properly and efficiently is a surefire way to ensure your final product doesn’t live up to the initial promises. According to multiple studies done only around 60% or less of digital projects are actually a success, this is due to a variety of factors. One of which being a disconnect between the digital side of the project and the management skills of those involved, whilst a proficient website builder may excel in the aesthetic design and navigation they may fail to align with the intentions of the website and ultimately miss the point of the website in the first place. Having a fixed plan rather than an agile methodology to work from is another brick wall that doesn’t need to be put up, working to a set plan that you cannot deviate from may provide rigorous structure but in the digital world where things need to be chopped and changed on a regular basis this just isn’t feasible. The kanban method is a fine example of how digital projects can be successfully managed whilst retaining all those moving parts, using Trello to document the works in progress and noting any bugs that need fixing. A lack of communication therefore is a major factor you have to consider, having so many aspects to a project can be overwhelming and you need to know what everyone else on the team is up to so that you can have a coherent workflow with each project member. Autonomous work is great and encouraged in many spaces in the IT sector but leaving your team out of the loop is a big red flag and is discouraged at every turn.

    <h1>Unit 1: Questions 3 & 4</h1>

    <p>
        Starting with the most obvious skill requirements, project management is essential as always, its implementation into the digital world follows largely the same rules as its predecessor. Those rules being effective communication, good time management, problem solving skills and an awareness of the overall scope of the project. The lean method dictates a minimisation of waste without sacrificing productivity, in the digital industry time is a valuable commodity and within the lean method we have ‘Kanban’. Kanban works by visualising the progress of a project and the current workload through apps like Trello. It aims to minimise the works in progress so that a pile up of work does not occur, this proves incredibly useful when trying to gauge the amount of work people are capable of outputting at any given time and ensuring they don’t over promise and under deliver.

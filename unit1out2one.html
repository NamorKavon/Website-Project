            I have been using Trello to record the unit questions I have been answering, I assigned a card to each unit and outcome, within the card I listed the references I used in the activity section and in the description I noted the question itself. After answering the questions I added the final google docs as a PDF attachment. I am enjoying using Trello as its been a key component in keeping my work organised in a manner I can return to and edit if I so choose. As for Visual Studio I haven’t had experience with any other code writing software but in respect to how I’ve found its application I find it easy to become accustomed to and it has been incredibly useful to edit code and see where I’ve done well and where I need to improve. The functionality of VS Code is fantastic and it’s incredibly easy to navigate around and as of yet I’ve not found myself struggling to get it to do something I needed. With regards to creating the website VS Code has been instrumental in live testing bits of code I’m experimenting with, it is as simple as making a change and refreshing your web page to see the results. Translating the written code into a visible web page is a rewarding feeling that has really encouraged me to further experiment with aspects of the website, trying to improve the look and feel with each iteration I create.

            With regards to the tasked project I think the tools provided were fully appropriate and each had their own uses which aided me in completing the project. Visual Studio is an incredibly efficient program and provided all the coding elements I required to build the functionality of the website in HTML5 and the aesthetic element in CSS. The ability to split your screen between the CSS file and whichever HTML you are working on is not only a great timesaver but it also enabled me to simply glance across to check my classes and IDs directly correlated with whichever part of the main.css file I was currently editing. VS Code provides organisation to the project in terms of the code itself, similar to how Trello is useful for organising the plan and scope of the project. Trello is a great tool for structuring the definable aspects of what needs to be done, to do, doing and done is a simple concept but inexplicably wise, used correctly you can accurately map out each stage of the project and it’s a great feeling when something you have been working hard on can finally be moved from doing to done. Personally I used Trello to good effect, reminding myself of pieces of code I could implement, organising the questions and answers, including attachments to the completed documents and references for my answers.

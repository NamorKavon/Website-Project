        To begin with I used Trello to organise the information chunks on the website, assigning a card to each paragraph of text, mainly so that I can keep track of where I am up to but also in case I need to go back and edit any text later on. Provisionally I think i’ll employ a tool such as ‘Slickplan’ to create a flowchart-esque structure of the website. I found a great tool to use online for the general planning of the website, the P.L.A.N acronym - Prepare, Landscape, Aesthetics and Navigation. I need to cleanly and concisely lay out the choices made for how the website will handle and what features it will contain; as well as ensuring the look and feel of the website is professional so it stands out and grabs the users attention, finally I must deal with the navigation of the website and how I intend for users to navigate around the website, perhaps a landing page that provides an introduction and then provides the user with options to navigate to any page they wish. I imagine some form of image manipulation software will also be used to add some of the aesthetic aspects to the website.

        In figuring out the systems required and software you’ll need there is a general framework of questions you must ask and answer before beginning your search; what is the scope of the project and how complex is it going to be? How quick is the development speed and what will be the cost of that development as well as IT experts you may employ? What are the technical requirements of the project and what tools/ready-made solutions are already available to help aid you in moving forward? We can divide digital projects into 3 basic groups; Simple, medium and large. A simple digital project is going to consist of things like a business’ website, a phone application or a small-scale online store, it’s going to require much less time, resources and money than the next 2 groups and ready-made templates are often available to assist you. Medium projects are where things start to get more drawn out and complicated, we’re looking at complex online stores that have a nationwide scope and also national scale services like the government gateway. This usually requires a framework to work from that’s personally built for the project and would involve a bigger team of people than its smaller counterpart. The largest of the 3 groups is really expanding the digital project to its most complex and involved stage. Wikipedia is perhaps the most prominent example of such a project, a website consisting of an almost innumerable amount of topics and pages that are pulled from sources all over the web. This group are exclusively built using high level programming languages like Python and Javascript and take a good level of experience to maintain.

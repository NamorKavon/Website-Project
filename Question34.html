        Starting with the most obvious skill requirements, project management is essential as always, its implementation into the digital world follows largely the same rules as its predecessor. Those rules being effective communication, good time management, problem solving skills and an awareness of the overall scope of the project. The lean method dictates a minimisation of waste without sacrificing productivity, in the digital industry time is a valuable commodity and within the lean method we have ‘Kanban’. Kanban works by visualising the progress of a project and the current workload through apps like Trello. It aims to minimise the works in progress so that a pile up of work does not occur, this proves incredibly useful when trying to gauge the amount of work people are capable of outputting at any given time and ensuring they don’t over promise and under deliver.

        To begin with I used Trello to organise the information chunks on the website, assigning a card to each unit of questions, mainly so that I can keep track of where I am up to but also in case I need to go back and edit any text later on. Provisionally I thought i’d employ a tool such as ‘Slickplan’ to create a flowchart-esque structure of the website. I found a great tool to use online for the general planning of the website, the P.L.A.N acronym - Prepare, Landscape, Aesthetics and Navigation. I need to cleanly and concisely lay out the choices made for how the website will handle and what features it will contain; as well as ensuring the look and feel of the website is professional so it stands out and grabs the users attention, finally I dealt with the navigation of the website and how I intend for users to navigate around the website, initially I thought perhaps a landing page that provides an introduction and then provides the user with options to navigate to any page they wish. I imagine some form of image manipulation software will also be used to add some of the aesthetic aspects to the website. I intended to make the website functionally pleasing as well as aesthetically, placing importance on the looks of the website and making sure it stands out but just as crucially making the feel and navigation a pleasant experience rather than a headache. This would include not placing large blocks of text on a page that you have to endlessly scroll through but rather navigate the unit questions by unit.

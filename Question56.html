    <h1>Unit 1: Questions 5 & 6</h1>

    <p>
        To begin with I used Trello to organise the information chunks on the website, assigning a card to each paragraph of text, mainly so that I can keep track of where I am up to but also in case I need to go back and edit any text later on. Provisionally I think i’ll employ a tool such as ‘Slickplan’ to create a flowchart-esque structure of the website. I found a great tool to use online for the general planning of the website, the P.L.A.N acronym - Prepare, Landscape, Aesthetics and Navigation. I need to cleanly and concisely lay out the choices made for how the website will handle and what features it will contain; as well as ensuring the look and feel of the website is professional so it stands out and grabs the users attention, finally I must deal with the navigation of the website and how I intend for users to navigate around the website, perhaps a landing page that provides an introduction and then provides the user with options to navigate to any page they wish. I imagine some form of image manipulation software will also be used to add some of the aesthetic aspects to the website.

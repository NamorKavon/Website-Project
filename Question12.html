        <p2 class="makeleft">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</p2>
    </div>

    <p>
The role of IT in the modern world is an integral and necessary one. 
Innovation, efficiency and productivity have seen a quantum surge in the 
21st century and business is taking full advantage of this fact. 
Look to the world of online shopping and how the high street brick and 
mortar stores are suffering as a result. The experience of shopping for 
clothes is slowly being replaced by the relative ease of browsing through 
hundreds of clothing items in a considerably quicker manner, all of this 
without ever leaving the comfort of your home. The rise of social media 
a ‘la Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat has given marketing a digital makeover.
It is no longer cost effective to solely advertise with billboards and 
newspapers when influencers with millions of followers can reach such a 
broad audience, with the added benefit of targeting the specific market 
you want and not just people who happen to notice an advertisement on the 
back of a bus. Communication is as much a part of using IT as any other, 
in today’s world we can seamlessly talk to the entire company, of which 
there could be 500 staff members, at the click of a button. This allows 
employees to relay information quickly and concisely without having to 
wait hours or days for a response. In a world gone by a company may store 
a swathe of physical files and folders in an entire offices worth of space, 
it would be tediously slow to sift through and no matter how organised it 
never did and never will compete with digital organisation systems. 
We can now store practically unlimited amounts of documents that the 
whole company can access within seconds with a simple search request, 
expediting the process by a considerable amount. Customer relationship management 
also is now a fantastic method to use when communicating with a customer; 
we can within seconds access their purchase history, address/billing details, 
any previous complaints and effectively use this information to make the procedure 
more seamless and pleasant for the customer. The best part being each interaction 
is a bit more information to be added to the system so the next experience can be 
even better for the consumer.

        <p3 class="makeright">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </p3>
    </div>



    <p1>
        Starting with the most obvious skill requirements, project management is essential as always, its implementation into the digital world follows largely the same rules as its predecessor. Those rules being effective communication, good time management, problem solving skills and an awareness of the overall scope of the project. The lean method dictates a minimisation of waste without sacrificing productivity, in the digital industry time is a valuable commodity and within the lean method we have ‘Kanban’. Kanban works by visualising the progress of a project and the current workload through apps like Trello. It aims to minimise the works in progress so that a pile up of work does not occur, this proves incredibly useful when trying to gauge the amount of work people are capable of outputting at any given time and ensuring they don’t over promise and under deliver. Communication is as important as ever, receiving updates on the project is a big key in keeping everyone on the same page and ensuring project members don’t stray away from the agenda. On another note your expertise on the given subject is integral to the finished product. For all the aesthetically brilliant design you may be capable of if you haven’t understood the brief and miss out key information your project may fall upon deaf ears, ultimately resulting in the project being redundant.

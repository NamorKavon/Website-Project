            On reviewing the methods I used to complete the project I note that there was very little teamwork involved and whilst it was a solo project it would have been productive to have conversations with colleagues on how they were approaching their own project to give both parties a better understanding of the task at hand. To do this efficiently I would have certainly used Slack to communicate, it’s an effective tool in letting you relay information and talk to others without the hassle of physically having to get out of your seat and go and find the person to ask questions or discuss useful methods. So next time I would definitely be sharing ideas and having conversations to expand my knowledge and give me multiple perspectives to work from. Productivity apps like Trello really give you as much benefit as the amount of effort you put into them, in future I would try to maximise my usage of Trello so I could spend less time deciding on how my project should proceed.

            Considering the testing of digital solutions we must consider how a website will perform across a multitude of devices, whilst a site may be functional on one browser it may be completely broken on another. Complicating matters further we need to take into account mobile and tablet devices and how our digital solution will perform on those platforms, we need to prove the solution is completely accessible. As an initial step in figuring out the testing process we need to research which platforms and devices are most commonly used by the audience/market and target those first. If the website is already published you can use tools like Google Analytics to understand from which platforms the market is viewing the site on. Knowing this we must be testing the solution on multiple browsers and tablet/phone devices to ensure that the results are consistently functional and accessible. It is good practise to use a ‘base browser’ to establish the ideal solution first and then begin to translate that elsewhere as needed. Considering network speed is crucial in how a website performs it would be wise to test the website at different speeds to see how it performs over Ethernet connection, 4G, 3G and Wi-Fi. Finally, going over written code is never a bad idea, there may be aspects of the website that don’t perform to the standard set by other elements on the site, due to incorrectly formatted code or bugs in the software. Applications and businesses are available to assist in all of these areas, with specialists in multiple coding languages able to really stress test a digital solution to work out the bugs and improve the efficiency.
